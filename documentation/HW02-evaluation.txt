Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.2, good point for a rule-based architecture in terms of the game having
a set of rules that must be followed in order to play.  However, in the case
of 'architecture', a rule-based system is something different.  It uses sets
of rules and sets of 'facts' which trigger the rules; this is the kind of an
architecture you would use for diagnostics like in health care or car repair
but I'm sure it could be adapted for games.  You bring up a good point!

Very nice state diagram on 5.8.

On 6.2 the inheritance diagram, what about having a 'Shape' class as one of
the sub-classes of 'Drawable', then have 'Rectangle', 'Ellipse', and 'Star'
be sub-classes of the 'Shape' class?  That way you could move things that
don't have to be part of 'Line' or 'Text' into something else so that those
two sub-classes aren't inheriting things they don't need.

Great job, Tori, you're doing really well ~ keep up the good work!!
