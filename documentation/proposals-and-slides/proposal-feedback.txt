CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Tori Wei
Living Archive project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Great work on the document.  The description is at high enough level to
   give the reader an overview, and yet low enough level to let the reader
   know what some of the planned technologies are that you are using, and
   what they will be used for, as well as what you have planned as a
   follow-on for this project this semester.

   The justification section is also well done, and serves to highlight your
   various interests, making this a true culmination to your career at LMU.
   Very nice!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Excellent job on the presentation!  You presented very well, and drove in
   the point of how important this project is.  You did great keeping the
   audience engaged and the slides make good use of graphics ~ simple and
   not distracting, but adding interest.


=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
