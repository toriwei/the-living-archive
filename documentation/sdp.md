# 4.1 Software Development Plan

## 4.1 Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for The Living Archive, a web application that serves as an interactive archive for queer histories at Loyola Marymount University.

With this web app, users will be able to view and search the archive, view data visualizations of the archive content, submit their own archival records, and if they are an approved administrator, manage submissions. Developing these features will require integrating a data visualization API, creating a submission form connected to the existing archive database, and setting up an authentication log-in process. The web app archive is currently supported through Google Firebase, so all these new features will be integrated into the existing databases.

Deliverable Schedule

## 4.3 Project Organization

This section outlines the major functions and their primary tasks for The Living Archive.

### 4.3.1 Frontend

Frontend development will consist of creating the interfaces and functionality for the web app. The primary tasks include using React to create the submission and administrator pages, integrate user interaction into the data visualization charts, and make the app responsive on both web and mobile platforms.

### 4.3.2 Backend

Backend development will consist of managing the databases, designing authentication protocol, and integrating the data visualization API. Because the main archive database is already functional, the primary responsibility will be incorporating edit and delete functionality into the database.

### 4.3.3 Research

Loyola Marymount Universityâ€™s Archives and Special Collections department will be consulted for this project to ensure correct permissions are requested when collecting user submissions. University archives will also be gathered from the Archives digital collections to be displayed on the web app.
