Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Great work on this specification, Tori!  It would be nice to have a little
   introduction paragraph at the start of the document to explain what is
   covered, but otherwise this is very good!

-- Functional Requirements
   Your use of epics and child stories is perfect!  Good acceptance criteria
   too.  The only comment I have is that the numbering of the child stories
   is a bit off.  Epic 2 had user stories 3 and 4, then epic 3 has those two
   numbers again...  :)

   It would help to have the sections identified as "functional requirements"
   and "performance requirements" and "environment requirements" to help the
   reader more easily find those requirements by category.

-- Performance Requirements
   Same comment as functional requirements... nice work!

-- Environment Requirements
   Again, nice job on these.  Good thinking to include the way you will do
   distribution, which considers maintenance updates.  Yours is the only SRS
   that took it into account!  Nice job.

your score:  10% out of 10% which is an A-plus

All in all, an excellent first effort, with only that re-numbering thing to
do before perfection is achieved.

Make the changes as suggested above for the second submission.

No changes or updates made to this document that I can see, although technically
none were required, other than the heading suggestions.  Excellent, Tori!
